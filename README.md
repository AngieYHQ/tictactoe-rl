##Mini game for family fun

Inspired by the captivating AlphaGo documentary, this mini-game project was developed to engage my nieces and nephews, encouraging less screen time (especially on YouTube). It's a simplified take on an AI agent, applying core principles seen in advanced AI to the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

✅ Uses search to simulate futures

✅ Uses learning to get smarter over time

## Objective: Create a fully runnable Tic Tac Toe agent (simplified AlphaGo-style) that uses:

✅ Planning (simulating future moves)

✅ Value learning (basic reinforcement learning)

✅ Self-play
